# Future Example Ideas

Didn't write this, clearly:

* `Todo List App`: A simple task management or todo list application is a common example used to demonstrate basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* `Blog Platform`: A blogging platform can showcase features like user authentication, text editing, media upload, comment system, likes, and categorization.
* `E-Commerce Site`: This type of application can demonstrate more complex functionalities like shopping cart management, product search and filters, inventory management, payment gateway integration, and customer reviews.
* `Chat Application`: A real-time chat app would be an excellent way to showcase real-time capabilities, WebSocket usage, and handling of concurrent user sessions.
* `Restaurant Booking System`: This type of app can demonstrate features like calendar and time slot management, email notifications, user reviews, and integration with Google Maps or other mapping services.
* `Weather App`: An app that pulls data from an external API (like a weather API) can show off how your framework handles external requests, async operations, caching, and displaying live data.
* `Fitness Tracker`: This type of app can demonstrate the handling of complex numerical data, chart/graph generation, and possibly integration with device sensors if your framework supports it.
* `Social Media Dashboard`: A dashboard that aggregates content from various social media platforms can show off the handling of various API types, data visualization, and possibly real-time updates.
* `Image Gallery`: An app to upload, categorize, and display images can showcase file handling, tagging, and possibly image processing or manipulation.
* `Job Board`: An app where users can post and apply for jobs can demonstrate user roles, complex forms, filtering, and searching.
